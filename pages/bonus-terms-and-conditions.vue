            <h5 class="mt-4 text-3xl font-normal pb-3">BONUS TERMS</h5>
            <div class="text-base font-normal pl-2">
              <p class="pb-3">The player is responsible for checking and understanding the bonus terms and conditions before participating in any bonus promotional offer (free chips, deposit agreement, comp points, cashback, manager bonuses, etc.). By redeeming any bonus, the Player accepts the bonus conditions listed below.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">Wagering requirements apply to all casino bonuses. Before any payout can be made, the bonus must be wagered 35X. For example: the Eligible Player must wager the First Deposit amount plus the First Bonus amount 35 times to withdraw any funds won using the First Bonus. The Eligible Player will then need to wager the Second Deposit amount plus the Second Bonus amount 35 times to withdraw the funds won using the Second Bonus.</p>
              <p>The up to $1800 combined Welcome Offer consists of the following:</p>
              <p>200% Welcome Bonus up to $600 on the first deposit plus 100 free spins. Promo Code: 1STDEP</p>
              <p>100% bonus up to $600 on the second deposit. Promo Code: 2NDDEP</p>
              <p class="pb-3">100% bonus up to $600 on the third deposit. Promo Code: 3RDDEP</p>
              <p class="pb-3">Any bonus you will be limited to a maximum withdrawal value of 6 times your deposit amount and any remaining balance will be forfeited. This clause will only be applied at the discretion of casino management.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">The maximum cashout on free spins is $50 or currency equivalent. Make sure you have adequate funds available before requesting a withdrawal. When you request a withdrawal, the bonus amount will be subtracted automatically.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">Due to the importance of fair gameplay, there is a limit on the maximum wager size that can be placed during the playthrough of any promotion bonuses (including cashback offers). Unless otherwise stated, the maximum wager amount permitted is $5 or currency equivalent. Any winnings will be void if you bet more than $5 or currency equivalent during an active playthrough.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">The bet must be placed when the game is selected. During the use of the bonus, bets made on games excluded from the bonus are considered invalid. The player must be aware of the bonus terms and conditions when taking advantage of any promotional offer.</p>
              <p>Each game may contribute differently for the bonus wagers. The Player can check the contribution table in the cashier section of their account after redeeming a bonus for details</p>
              <p>100%: all slots, Keno and scratch cards (re-spins on slots contribute 10%)</p>
              <p>50%: All NetEnt games as well as Red Tiger Games</p>
              <p>8%: Poker tables, Roulettes, Video/Power poker, Blackjack and Casino War</p>
              <p>2%: Classic Blackjack, All Aces and Jacks or Better video poker</p>
              <p class="pb-3">0%: Baccarat, Craps, Red Dog, Sic Bo and Progressive games</p>
              <p class="pb-3">The casino does not automatically apply bonuses to the Player's account. If the Player wishes to claim a promotional bonus, he must first redeem the coupon code before making a deposit.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">You are only eligible for one free bonus before your first deposit. All winnings will be declared void if more than one bonus is claimed without making a deposit.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">Each bonus can only be given once per address / computer / IP address / household / player / account according to the general terms of use. In case of opening multiple accounts, the casino reserves the right to block the account and void the remaining account balance.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">When using the bonus, bets must be made first from the player's cash balance and then from the bonus.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">Prizes from feature guaranteed games, compensation points, slot competitions, progressive jackpot games or other events are subject to the bonus terms in effect at the time of the prize.</p>

              <p class="pb-3">If the Casino mistakenly credits your Player Account with a bonus or winnings that do not belong to you, whether due to a technical issue, error in the paytables, human error or otherwise, the amount and/or the winnings from such bonus will remain the Casino property and will be deducted from your Player Account. If you have withdrawn funds that do not belong to you prior to us becoming aware of the error, the mistakenly paid amount will (without prejudice to other remedies and actions that may be available at law) constitute a debt owed by you to us.
