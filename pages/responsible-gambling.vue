              <p class="pb-3">We ensure that the games we offer bring joy to all who choose to play, but we know that we have a responsibility to all of our players.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">While we understand that for many people, online gaming is a hobby and great fun, gambling can lead to some players becoming addicted and thus using our services to feed their addiction.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">To ensure you play responsibly, we've suggested some guidelines to follow:</p>
            </div>
            <h5 class="mt-4 text-3xl font-normal pb-3">Responsible gambling</h5>
            <div class="text-base font-normal pl-2">
              <p class="pb-3">1. Do not play if you are recovering from an addiction or under the influence of the following substances</p>
              <p class="pb-3">under the influence of alcohol or any other substance.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">2. Give yourself a set amount of time to play and limit yourself to that amount of time whether you win or lose.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">3. Do not rely on gambling as a source of income or to chase your losses.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">4. Don't let gambling interfere with other aspects of your daily life.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">5. Set yourself limits within your means, both for buying and for losses, before you start.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">If at any time you feel that your gambling is becoming irresponsible, our casino hosts have many options available to assist you and connect you with professionals or point you in the right direction for further assistance. You can ask us to replace the following on our site:</p>
              <p class="pb-3">a) Deposit limits - We can help by setting daily, weekly or even monthly limits for you to ensure that</p>
              <p class="pb-3">so that you can control the amounts spent, we can do this on request.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">and it can even be requested for a specific period of time, after which we can return to the review if you wish.</p>
              <p class="pb-3">b) Cooling off period - Take a break on your account; maybe you've had a bad turn and need a break;</p>
              <p class="pb-3">c) Self-exclusion - If you've tried all other alternatives, but you still don't feel like you're in control of the situation,</p>
              <p class="pb-3">self-exclusion may be the best option for you. To do this, talk to one of the casino hosts who will be happy to make arrangements for you.</p>
